# Introduction
The `cheese` package contains tools for working with data during statistical analysis--promoting flexible, intuitive, and reproducible workflows. There are functions designated for specific statistical tasks such as

* `univariate_table()`: To create a custom table of descriptive statistics for a dataset
* `univariate_associations()`: For computing pairwise association metrics for combinations of `predictors` and `responses`
* `descriptives()`: To compute descriptive statistics on columns of a dataset

These are built on a collection of data manipulation tools designed for general use, many of which are motivated by the functional programming concept (i.e. `purrr`) and use non-standard evaluation for column selection as in `dplyr::select`. Here are a few:

* `depths()`: Find the depth(s) of elements in a list structure that satisfy a predicate
* `divide()` and `fasten()`: Split/bind data frames to/from any list depth
* `dish()`: Evaluate a function with pairwise combinations of columns
* `stratiply()`: Evaluate a function on subsets of a data frame
* `typly()`: Evaluate a function on columns that inherit at least one (or none) of the specified classes

# Installation

*   From CRAN (current version 0.0.3)

`install.packages("cheese")`

*   From source (in development)

`devtools::install_github("zajichek/cheese")`

# Usage
```{r}
#Load package
require(cheese)

#Make a descriptive table
heart_disease %>%
  univariate_table(
    format = "markdown" #Could also render as "html", "latex", "pandoc", or "none"
  )
#Run some models
heart_disease %>%

  #Apply a function to subsets of the data
  stratiply(
    by = Sex,
    f =
      ~.x %>%
      
      #Apply a function to pairwise combinations of columns
      dish(
        left = c(ExerciseInducedAngina, HeartDisease),
        f = function(y, x) glm(y ~ x, family = "binomial") %>% purrr::pluck("coefficients") %>% tibble::enframe()
      )
  ) %>%
    
    #Bind rows up to a specified depth
    fasten(
      into = c("Outcome", "Predictor"),
      depth = 1
    )
```
